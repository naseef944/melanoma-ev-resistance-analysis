# Gene Expression Analysis: Control vs. Treated

This project simulates RNA-seq data to study gene expression changes in cells treated with a drug. It uses R packages DESeq2 and clusterProfiler for differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis.

## Structure
- `data/`: Simulated gene counts and metadata
- `scripts/`: R scripts for each analysis step
- `results/`: Outputs including plots and DE tables
## ðŸ“Š Results

All final result files are located in the [`results/`](results/) directory, including:

- Volcano and PCA plots
- Top expressed genes barplot
- KEGG pathway enrichment dotplot
- DESeq2 RDS object and DE tables
- ðŸ“„ [Final PDF Report](results/melanoma_drug_resistance_final_report.pdf)
